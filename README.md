# sssom-on-fhir-content
SSSOM static files and conversion tools.

Potentially just a temporary library. Current use cases:
- Functional, easy to use converter while `sssom-py`'s FHIR functionality is still being developed.
- Ad hoc mutations of source files (programmatic and documented manual steps).
